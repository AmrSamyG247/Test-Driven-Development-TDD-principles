Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles ALX Slack cohort_13 Tasks By Amr Samy

@channelChallenge -1 : Python Coding Challenge: Test-Driven Development Practice   Implement a function called `reverse_string(string)` that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.Your task is to write the implementation code for the `reverse_string()` function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Start by writing test cases to cover different scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.Here are a few test cases to get you started:
Test Case 1: assert reverse_string("Hello") == "olleH"
Test Case 2: assert reverse_string("") == ""
Remember, follow the TDD process: Think: Define the requirements and expectations for the `reverse_string()` function. Test: Write test cases that validate the expected behavior of the function. Code: Implement the `reverse_string()` function using the simplest code possible to pass the tests. Refactor: If needed, optimize and improve your code while ensuring the tests remain green. GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository for this coding challenge. Push your solution and tests to the repository, organizing your code neatly and maintaining a clear structure. Share Your Solution
Once you've completed the challenge, share the link to the repository's test file in the comments. This way, others can review your implementation and provide feedback.Get ready to showcase your coding skills and embrace the power of Test-Driven Development! Let the challenge begin! Happy coding and testing!  (edited)

@Challenge - 2: Implement a function called `count_vowels(string)` that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the given string. Consider both lowercase and uppercase vowels.Your task is to write the implementation code for the `count_vowels()` function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Begin by writing test cases to cover various scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.Here are a few test cases to get you started:
Test Case 1 : assert count_vowels("Hello") == 2
Test Case 2 : assert count_vowels("") == 0
Take on this challenge and follow the TDD process: Think: Define the requirements and expectations for the `count_vowels()` function. Test: Write test cases that validate the expected behavior of the function. Code: Implement the `count_vowels()` function using the simplest code possible to pass the tests. Refactor: If necessary, optimize and improve your code while ensuring the tests remain green. GitHub Repository

@Challenge - 3: Implement a function called count_unique_elements(arr) that takes a list of integers arr as input and returns the count of unique elements in the list.Your task is to write the implementation code for the count_unique_elements() function using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Begin by writing test cases to cover various scenarios, and then write the code to make those tests pass.Here are a few test cases to get you started:Test Case 1:
assert count_unique_elements([4, 2, 9, 1, 7]) == 5
Test Case 2: assert count_unique_elements([8, 3, 5, 0, -2, 8, 3]) == 6
Test Case 3: assert count_unique_elements([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 1
Challenge yourself with this coding exercise and follow the TDD process: Think: Define the requirements and expectations for the `count_unique_elements()` function. Test: Write test cases that validate the expected behavior of the function. Code: Implement the `count_unique_elements()` function to count the number of unique elements in the list. Refactor: If necessary, optimize and improve your code while ensuring the tests remain green. GitHub Repository
